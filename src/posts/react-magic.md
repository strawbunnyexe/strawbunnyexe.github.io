summary: "How I went from curious beginner to confident developer, one React hook at a time."

When I first looked at React, I remember thinking:  
> *“Wait… what’s `useState` and why does it look like black magic?”*

Back then, JSX felt strange, components were confusing, and state felt like this mysterious force I couldn’t quite grasp. But despite that, I was *hooked*. (Pun intended.)

## ✨ The Beginning

I started with the basics: functional components, props, and lots of `console.log()`. React challenged the way I thought about building interfaces—but in a good way. It gave me structure and power, while still letting my creativity breathe.

## ⚙️ Hooks, Effects & Frustrations

Learning `useEffect` was a turning point. Suddenly, I could control side effects and make my components more dynamic. But oh, the bugs I wrestled with! Infinite loops, missing dependencies, and that dreaded "memory leak" warning...

I learned to slow down, read the docs, and trust the process. Every bug became a teacher. Every breakthrough, a little celebration.

## 🎨 Building My Portfolio

The real magic happened when I built my portfolio site with React. Animations with Framer Motion, custom theming, dynamic routes, and even a Markdown-based blog (like this one!)—each piece helped me grow.

It wasn’t just about code. It was about **telling my story** through components and styles. React became more than a tool. It became a canvas.

## 🌱 Where I’m Headed

React keeps evolving, and so do I. There’s still so much to learn—server components, suspense, performance tuning—but I’m no longer afraid. I’m excited.

To anyone just starting: take your time. Celebrate the small wins. Your journey might look different, but you’ll find your rhythm.

Thanks for reading 💖
