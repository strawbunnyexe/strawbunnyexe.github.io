The ideal Hispanic girl:
- Long straight hair
- An hourglass figure
- Feminine and sexy clothes

## Long straight hair

Straight long flowy hair is the norm. But I was born with curly hair as part of my Dominican and Peruvian heritage. On my mom’s side of the family from Peru, everyone has straight hair but I got unlucky in the genetic lottery. My dad’s side of the family has similar hair to mine but I don’t see it often. The men shave off their hair completely while the women would straighten or perm it every day. This is common in the Dominican Republic. So I should probably do the same, right?

My mom and aunts would brush my hair, pulling it while trying to untangle it since no one knew how to take care of it. When they weren’t brushing it, they would bring out the hair iron to straighten it. The constant heat burned my hair, damaging it to be brittle and dry. It would burn my skin at times and it hurt a lot. My cries wouldn’t be heard and instead, my relatives would yell at me to stay seated so they can finish. My curly hair was a mess and it had to be fixed so I can be beautiful. I shouldn’t cry.

At my quinceanera, I wore a teal dress and put on some makeup to get ready for my big day. I thought that maybe I could keep my hair the way it naturally is. But my aunt didn’t agree. She took me to a room and straighten my hair. After that, everyone called me beautiful as I smiled at the guests and let them take photos. As the crown was put on my head, I sat on the chair, a doll displayed for others. They were happy to see me grow up to be a beautiful girl. I was happy because they were happy. But that lingering disappointment was in my mind. That I couldn’t keep my natural curls for a celebration about me.

I didn’t like the look. If I could, I would change it to something different. Maybe a curly haircut shorter and neutral. Why? Not sure.

## An hourglass figure

A small waist and a large bust. A figure that others may strive for. As I got older, my body developed more and more. And to people, that was great. I had such a nice figure. The compliments made me happy since who doesn’t like to be complimented? 

But why did I also feel gross? When older men who are complete strangers would stare at my teenage body with a look of desire. While my parents would always be there to protect me, those looks were burned into my brain. At times I wish I can undo my body shape to what it was back then. Especially my chest. It kept on bothering me. And it got worse as I continued growing.

I just wanted to flatten my chest or cover it up any way I can. Get those oversized shirts and sweaters ready to hide everything. Say no to the family beach trip to everyone’s dismay. A beach trip meant wearing a swimsuit and a swimsuit meant an exposed figure on display for strangers. That was always an awful experience. I wanted to just bury myself in the sand since it was a way to hide and it was fun too.

To be born to have an ideal figure meant it had to be maintained. Make sure my body stayed that shape forever. Avoid eating a lot of food or else I will gain weight. If I were to gain a lot of weight, then my beauty would be gone. And there would be no going back from that. The stretch marks on my body will never go away and that was a misfortune. There were flaws. That I fail the task of staying pretty. I was anxious. Would others throw me away if they saw those flaws and a broken doll?

People told me that it was a shame that I didn’t show off my figure. My parents were worried about me. They hated to see their child insecure and would assure me I looked beautiful. Why couldn’t I be more confident? I didn’t know why. I felt off in my own body. I felt something was wrong. Not just with the stares but with myself. Everyone else said that I looked great but why didn’t I feel the same?

## Feminine and sexy clothes

I don’t mind dressing up nicely. Wear the occasional dress, put on makeup, or have some jewelry on me. Girls who wore their outfits in pure bliss and confidence were amazing to me. I admire them for their choice to be themselves. I wanted to be just like them. But no matter how hard I tried, I still wanted to hide everything from everyone.

If I had to go somewhere, I had to wear something that would impress others. Even if the outfit made me feel uncomfortable. A dress that showed a lot of my chest. Or high heels that I can’t walk in and almost made me fall down the stairs. Of course, I wanted to appease my relatives and show that I am the perfect girl. That I am and will continue to be beautiful. Clothes that people around me call “sexy” and that will surely impress the boys. Like what my aunt said at my quinceanera, “At the age of 15, back then, this celebration meant she would be ready for marriage. And I know such a beautiful girl would have others wanting her.” While I know my aunt meant well by that joke, those words stayed in my mind.

To look a certain way for others and not myself. Rather than a person, I felt that I was a doll instead. Put on display for others to see. Dressed in clothes to impress them. Being unable to be confident in those clothes made me feel that I failed in something.

Beauty standards from my culture placed on me for the longest time. I wanted to appease others so I let it affect me and how I viewed myself. But if stop thinking about that checklist and for myself, it still leaves that off feeling from my efforts to be the ideal girl. 

How did I want to look?

How did I want to express myself?

What did I want to be?

Who am I? A girl? Or something else?

A simple yet achievable list of things. Made by me and for me alone. Not constructed by others. So I can be myself. Not boy or girl. Just me.

The ideal me:
- Natural curly short hair
- Confident in my body despite flaws
- Androgynous and comfortable clothes

## Natural curly short hair

Slowly but surely, I am repairing years of damage to my hair. I step into the hair salon and got the first haircut I ever got alone. No hair iron and no cries of pain. I looked in the mirror and saw curls that I didn’t even know I had. Not just my hair was shining but my smile was too. Some people were surprised by my choice. On occasions, people suggest I grow my hair long again or straighten it. But their opinions don’t bother me. I like it. A lot.

## Confident in my body despite flaws

My stretch marks aren’t going away but I am still me. And the stares no longer bother me. While I can’t change how some people may look at me, I can change how I look at myself. Not restricted to a single mark or a number on a scale or measurement tape. I am healthy and that’s what matters to me. And as I wear that binder that flattens my chest, I feel like a person, not a boy or girl. I agree with my parents, I think I’m pretty.

## Androgynous and comfortable clothes

A series of trial and error. Finding out what I like and dislike in clothes. Who do I want to impress? Myself. There is no longer a display that confines me. I now stand with others like me who are confident in themselves.

Some people may not understand my choices. But with each new item added to my list, I am growing with my own form of beauty. With that, I am finally myself. The me that was kept hidden for so long. And I couldn’t be happier.
